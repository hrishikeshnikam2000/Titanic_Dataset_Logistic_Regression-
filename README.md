# Titanic_Dataset_Logistic_Regression

Building a Logistic Regression Machine Learning Model using the TITANIC Dataset 

This Machine Learning Model is well documented, each step is explained before writting code.

Jupyter Notebook is used beacuse of it's amazing features.

The code is written in python.

This model uses the analogy of Train Test Split.

The data-set is provided by Kaggle in .csv file.




## Feature of this particular Jupyter Notebook:-

1)Exploratory Data Analysis  

2)Well documented

3)Filling missing data

4)Cufflinks used!

5)Data Cleaning

6)Building a LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL which includes:-

    A)Train Test Split

    B)Training and Predicting

     C)Evaluation




## libraries Imported:- 

1)Sci-kit learn

2)Matplotlib

3)seaborn

4)pandas

5)numpy
